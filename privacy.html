    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>At Totally Legitimate Inc., your privacy is as important as our sense of humor (which is pretty high). Here's our
        promise to you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All your personal details are stored securely in our imaginary vault, guarded by unicorns and caffeinated
            hamsters.</li>
        <li>We only use your data to improve our impersonation skills and to send you the occasional memeâ€”no creepy
            surveillance, we swear.</li>
        <li>If you decide to take a stroll through our digital backyard, rest assured that your info will remain as
            confidential as our secret recipe for pizza sauce.</li>
        <li>You have the right to request a copy of your data. But fair warning: we might send it back in the form of a
            humorous haiku.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This policy may change if we decide to upgrade our unicorn security team or if aliens finally get a hold of our
        office. Check back often for updates!</p>
    <p>Got concerns or simply want to share a joke? <a href="mailto:arpitbaladas20@gmail.com">Drop us a line</a>!</p>
