    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of totally legitimate agreements! By using this form, you acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are willingly sharing personal information that may (or may not) be used for top-secret impersonation
            missions.</li>
        <li>All data you provide is accepted with a pinch of humor, a dash of irony, and a generous serving of “what the
            FUCK?”</li>
        <li>We promise not to sell your data to extraterrestrial beings—unless they offer us cosmic coupons.</li>
        <li>Any resemblance to actual legal terms is purely coincidental. We're here to have fun, not to lawyer up.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Proceed only if you're ready to embrace the absurdity of life and the inevitability of spam emails!</p>
